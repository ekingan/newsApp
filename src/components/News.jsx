						subtitle: 'How hot can we handle?',
						content: 'Back in 2003 a devastating heatwave rippled across Europe, causing the hottest summer on the continent since at least the year 1540. The sweltering heat caused a drought, a crop shortfall, and a death toll of more than 70,000. Now, a new study in Environmental Research Letters estimates that hundreds of those deaths can be blamed on manmade climate changeâ€”with roughly 500 deaths in Paris and 60 deaths in London directly attributable to the fact that the heatwave was made substantially worse by global warming. Overall, the study concludes that climate change increased the risk of heat-related death by 20 percent in London and 70 percent in Paris.',
